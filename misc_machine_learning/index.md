# Machine learning projects

This section has several ML study projects in addition to boston crimes project. These projects are smaller in size and scale, and were research project of kind. Project have text analytics with Azure, Neural Networks and PCA with R, and regressions with Python.

I see all these aspects as relevant areas in machine learning.
