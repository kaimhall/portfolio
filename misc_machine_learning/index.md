This section has several ML study projects in addition to boston crimes project. These projects are smaller in size and scale, and were research project of kind. Project have text analytics with Azure, Neural Networks and PCA with R, and regressions with Python.

I apologize, some materials are not fully narrated, and code is not explained very throughout yet. Any way, materials give examples of ML code I have written, and projects I have done.
